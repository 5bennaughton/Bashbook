Execute the client script with a user's parameter, or alternatively, launch the server script in one terminal and the client script in another. Initiating the client script prior to the server will result in the server script automatically starting in the background. Should the provided ID not exist initially, it will be created. Once the user is "logged in," they can issue commands without needing to re-enter their ID. The available commands include add, post, display, and exit. In cases where a user inputs a username consisting of multiple words, only the first word is recognized and processed by the program. The server remains operational as long as there are active clients.
